To prove the "Game Show Host" problem as described in the movie 21, also called the Monty Hall problem. Basically, you have the option of three doors. Behind two doors is a goat, behind the other is some valuable prize, we'll say a car. You pick one, and the host opens one of the remaining 2 door, behind which, is a goat. You are then given the option to change your pick. The host knows where the prize is. According to the movie, you should always switch your pick (I would never switch persoanlly) to account for variable change. You wnet somehow, from having a 33% chance of getting the prize initially, to a 66.7% chance of getting it if you change doors after the initial guess. I could not wrap my head around this, so this program I used to simualte this over many games, and it does in fact close in to 66.7% wins if you change your door after the first guess. Still don't fully understand it, but it works out.
